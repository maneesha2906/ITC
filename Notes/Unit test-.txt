Unit test:-
-->unit tests are the segments of codes that are written to test other modules and files that we refer to as a unit. 
-->Unit Testing is a very important part of the software development process that helps us to ensure that the code works properly without any errors.
-->The primary goal of Python unit testing is checking the validation that each unit of the software performs as designed, according to its specifications.
--> Each unit test looks at a small part of the code, making sure it works even when things get a little tricky.
-->So that programmers can find and fix mistakes early on.

Types of Python Testing Frameworks:-
Python has two main frameworks to make unit testing easier:

-->Unittest
-->Pytest
-->Nose or nose2
-->Doctest
